## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. View Workflow Status
Visit: https://github.com/RainTreeQ/sendall-extension/actions

You should see:
- ✅ E2E Monitor (Daily)
- ✅ Auto-Fix Selectors
- ✅ Retry Failed Platforms

### 2. Manual Test (Recommended)
```bash
# Go to Actions tab
# Click "E2E Monitor (Daily)"
# Click "Run workflow" button
# Select branch: master
# Click "Run workflow"
```

This will:
1. Test all 9 platforms
2. Generate test-results.json
3. If any fail → trigger auto-fix
4. Create PR in selectors repo

### 3. Simulate a Failure (Advanced)
```bash
# Temporarily break a selector
cd "/Users/quxianglin/Documents/vibe coding/sendol-selectors"
vim selectors.json
# Change chatgpt.findInput[0] to "#nonexistent-selector"
git add selectors.json
git commit -m "test: simulate selector failure"
git push

# Wait for next scheduled run (or trigger manually)
# System should:
# 1. Detect failure
# 2. Discover new selectors
# 3. Create PR with fix
# 4. Auto-merge if confidence > 95%

# Restore
git revert HEAD
git push
```

## 📧 Email Notifications (Optional)

If you want email alerts, add these secrets:

**Go to**: https://github.com/RainTreeQ/sendall-extension/settings/secrets/actions

**Add**:
1. `MAIL_USERNAME` = your-email@gmail.com
2. `MAIL_PASSWORD` = [Gmail App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
3. `NOTIFY_EMAIL` = where-to-send-alerts@example.com

**Without these secrets**: System still works, just no email notifications.

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Check System Health
1. **GitHub Actions**: https://github.com/RainTreeQ/sendall-extension/actions
   - Green checkmarks = all platforms working
   - Red X = auto-fix triggered

2. **Selectors Repo PRs**: https://github.com/RainTreeQ/sendol-selectors/pulls
   - Open PRs = waiting for your review
   - Merged PRs = auto-fixed successfully

3. **Test Results**: Check workflow logs
   - Click on any workflow run
   - View "Run E2E tests" step
   - See which platforms passed/failed

### Expected Behavior

**Normal Day (99% of time)**:
- Tests run 2x daily
- All pass ✅
- No action needed

**Platform Breaks (High Confidence)**:
- Test fails
- Auto-fix discovers selectors (98% confidence)
- PR auto-merged
- Email: "ChatGPT auto-fixed"
- **Your action**: None (just read email)

**Platform Breaks (Medium Confidence)**:
- Test fails
- Auto-fix discovers selectors (85% confidence)
- PR created (needs review)
- Email with PR link
- **Your action**: Click "Merge pull request" (30 seconds)

**Platform Breaks (Low Confidence)**:
- Test fails
- Auto-fix discovers selectors (65% confidence)
- PR created with warning
- Email with PR link
- **Your action**: Review carefully, merge or close (2-5 minutes)

## 🎯 Success Indicators

✅ **System is working if**:
- Workflows appear in Actions tab
- Scheduled runs execute 2x daily
- Test results are generated
- No errors in workflow logs

✅ **Auto-fix is working if**:
- Failed tests trigger auto-fix workflow
- Selector discovery completes
- PRs are created in selectors repo
- High confidence PRs auto-merge

✅ **Users are updating if**:
- Selectors repo has recent commits
- Users' extensions fetch every 12h
- No user complaints about broken platforms

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Workflows not appearing
- Check if .github/workflows/ files are pushed
- Verify YAML syntax is valid
- Check GitHub Actions is enabled in repo settings

### Tests failing but no auto-fix
- Check workflow logs for errors
- Verify auto-fix workflow has correct permissions
- Check if selectors repo URL is correct

### PRs not auto-merging
- Check if PR has "high-confidence" label
- Verify auto-merge workflow in selectors repo
- Check workflow permissions (needs contents: write)

### Discovery returns low confidence
- Normal for complex platforms
- Manual review recommended
- Can improve discovery algorithm over time
